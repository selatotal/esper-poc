# esper-poc
Simple project that uses Esper CEP Engine - http://www.espertech.com/esper - to process random Temperature events and show alerts.
 
It was based in [Adrian Milne post](https://www.adrianmilne.com/complex-event-processing-made-easy/) with some changes to use esper 8.5.0.

## How to Run
```bash
gradle run
```
It will start to create random temperatures and process them in the Esper Engine.
